Chapter 12 Quiz

1) What is downcast?

    Casting Down is the process of typecasting a pointer to base class as a pointer to a derived 
    class.

2) What does percolating functionality upward mean?

    Percolating upward is process of moving a method that is shared by multiple derived classes to 
    a common base class inorder for the derived classes to share the functionality. (Can lead to the 
    base class been treated as a global storage area for many methods.)

3)  If a round rectangle has straight edges and rounded corners, and your RoundRect class inherits
    both from Rectangle and from Circle, and they in turn bothe inherit from Shape, how many Shapes 
    are created.

    It depends if virtual inheritance is employed, if so both the circle and the rectangle can share
    a virtual shape base class meaning only one Shape class is created, otherwise they have one shape
    class each.

4)  If Horse and Bird inherit from Animal using public virtual Inheritance, do their constructors 
    intitalize the Animal constructor? If pegasus inherits from both Horse and Bird, how does it 
    initialize Animals constructor.

    When the keyword virtual is used only the most derived class will call the animal constructor, 
    in this case pegasus. But if no Pegasus is derived from wither horse or bird then they will call
    their own Animal constructor


5)  Declare a class called Vehicle and make it an abstract class.

    class Vehicle
    {
        virtual Move() = 0;
    }

6)  If a base class is an abstract classm and it has three pure virtual functions, how many of those 
    functions must be overridden in nits derrived classes?

    None unless you want to  make the class non abstract, in which case all must be overriden.
