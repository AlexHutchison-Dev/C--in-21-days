// Chapter 8 Quiz

1. What operator is used to determine the address of a variable?

	The address-of (&) operator gets the address of a variable e.g. pPointer = &a would set pPointer to the memory address of the variable a.

2. What operator is used to find the value stored at an address held in a pointer?

	* The dereferencing operator will find the value stored at the address in a pointer. e.g. *pPointer will return the value at the memory address stored in the pointer pPointer.

3. What is a Pointer?

	A pointer is a variable that stores the  memory address of another variable 

4. What is the difference berweem the address stored in a pointer and the value at that pointer?

	The address is a 64bit(nowadays was once 32bit)  hexidecimal number that references a location in the computers memory. Imagine it to be the number of your P.O Box and your mail to be the value stored at that address.

5. What is the difference between the indirection and address-of operators?

	The indirecrion operator or dereference operator (*) retrieves a value when the pointer is derefenced. e.g. *pPointer might return 10 cout << pPointer; would print the memory address stored in pPointer;

	The address-of (&) returns the address at which a variables value is stored as opposed to the value its self.  


6. What is the difference between const int * ptrOne and int * const ptrTwo?

	option 1 is an interger that is constant(cannot be changed) referenced by a pointer.

	option 2 is an interger referenced by a pointer that is constant and therefore may not point anwhere else in memory.
