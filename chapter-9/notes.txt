Notes on chapter 9.

I am puzzleing over the differences between references and pointers.  as of know I have this,

    
  a reference is an alias it merely acts as another name for a preexisting 
  variable, as oposed to a copy like you would get if you declared and 
  initialized int a = b; . 
  A reference is constant (cannot be changed) and also cannot be null.


    a pointer is simply a primitive data type that stores a memory address, 
    this can be the memory address of a previously declared variable.  When 
    reading its value it will return a hexadecimal memory address unless 
    dereferenced using the dereferencing operator (*) when it will return the 
   value stored at the memory address it holds.
