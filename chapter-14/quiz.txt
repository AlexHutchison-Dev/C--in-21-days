Chapter 14 Quiz

1) You hace a base class object pointerpBase. What cast would you use to determine wheter it is a
CDreived1 or CDerived2 type?

  dynamic_cast

2) You have a const reference to an object and tried calling a public member function, written by
you. The compiler does not allow this because the function in question is not a const member. Would
you update funcrtion or use the const_cast?

  As this is a function I have written I would correct the function definition, if this was some
function in a library then i would use const_cast.

3) reinterpret_cast should be used only when static_cast does not work ans the cast is known to be
required and safe, True or False?

  True. As this breaks the type safety and could lead to unforseen behavior or fatal errors.

4) Is it true that many instances of static_cast based conversions, especially between simple
sate-types would be pergpemed automatically by a good C++ compiler?

  Yes, in the vast majority of cases a standard Ctype cast is enough instruction for the compiler and
  in my opinion is far cleaner and easier to read.
