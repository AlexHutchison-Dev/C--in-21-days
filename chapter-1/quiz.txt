1: What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?

    An interpreter reads each line, converts it to a machine executable form, then runs it before moving on to the next line. 
    A compiler reads a sorce code file and converts it into an object file, in preperation for the linker to combine any linked libaries
    and produce an executable, to run later.

2: How do you compile the source code with your compiler?
    I enter the command "clang++ <filename>", then ./a.out to run the compiled program.

3. What does the linker do?
    The linker takes the object file that the compiler outputted and combine any libaries linked with the "#include' statement, making an
    executable file.

4. What are the steps of the Development Cycle?
    write code
    compile 
    if 
        errors return to step 1 and fix errors
    else 
        pass object file to linker
    if 
        errors return to step 1 and fix errors
    else 
        run executable
    if 
        errors return to step 1 and fix errors
    else
